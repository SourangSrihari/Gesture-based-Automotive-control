# Gesture-based-Automotive-control
The project enables vehicle and robot control through hand gestures, driven by computer vision and deep learning. OpenCV processes gestures, MediaPipe detects keypoints, and a trained FFNN interprets actions like MOVE or REVERSE using TensorFlow. This intuitive interface enhances user engagement for remote control.
